# Blackjack!
This is a recreation of a project I failed in my sophomore year of CS!
Hopefully this time I can ACTUALLY use pointers correctly :D

test.c is my attempt at making the entire project effectively from scratch in one file.
It currently has the same issue as the rest of the project in that it prints nothing after
compiling and runnign it :(((
